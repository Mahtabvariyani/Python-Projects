""" 
There are many Data Types in Python but in this file we gonna go thro the 4 of them .

* Intigers
** Floats
*** Strings
**** Boolean



1* 
Integers: Integers are numbers that can include both positive and negative values, such as -3, 5, or 66.

2** Floats: Floating-point numbers are decimal numbers, such as 33.3. However, not all numbers with a decimal point are floats. For example, the number 1 is an integer but can also be represented as a float.

3*** Strings: Strings are collections of characters, which can be sentences or individual words.



4**** Booleans: Booleans can only have two values: True or False. They are typically used to represent binary conditions, such as answering "Yes" or "No."




if you wanna check the type of the Data you can check with the type() for example 

type(2)
<class 'int'> --> int stands for Intigers

type(True)
<class 'bool'> --> Stands for Booleans
